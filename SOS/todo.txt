##### NEW FUNCTIONS #####
#########################

Extend the following methods to quotient rings:

1) createSOSModel
2) solveSOS
3) lasserreHierarchy
4) sosInIdeal

#########################
######## IMPROVE ########
#########################

The following methods need to be improved

1) realZeros should work on a nontrivial example
2) createSOSModel should be faster than solving the SDP
3) solveSDP should accept many PSD blocks
4) lasserreHierarchy, should allow inequalities (very hard)

Other issues

5) net(SOSPoly) should look nicer
6) perhaps we should use multigrading for handling parameters (e.g. solveSOS)

#########################
######## TESTING ########
#########################

Implement tests for the following methods

--1) cleanSOS--
--2) sub(SOSPoly,Ring)--
3) sosdec (missing over RR)
--4) toRing--
--5) roundPSDmatrix--
--6) blkDiag--
7*) LDLdecomposition
--8) genericCombination--
9*) choosemonp
10) createSOSModel

The following methods need a test that accepts the Solver as an input

14*) solveSDP
15*) solveSOS
16) sosdecTernary
17) sosInIdeal
18) lowerBound
--19) lasserreHierarchy--

The methods marked with (*) already have some tests, but need more.

NOTE: All methods must be tested with inputs over QQ and over RR.

#########################
####### DEBUGGING #######
#########################

Known bugs:

4) Numerators in bugs/sosdecTernaryHarris.m2 lie in different rings

5) In the first test of lasserreHierarchy it sometimes happens that
   rounding fails.  In this case the last few lines of solveSOS fail,
   because they call changePolyField with f being a matrix.  I can't
   reproduce this at the moment because rounding is always successful.

6) LDLdecomposition decomposes (matrix{{1,-1,1},{-1,1,1},{1,1,1}})
   but fails the test. Of course it has one eigenvalue negative, so it shouldn't decompose.

7) The following works over QQ but fails over RR (true solution -.178)
    R = RR[x,z]
    f = x^4+x^2+z^6-3*x^2*z^2;
    (bound,sol) = lowerBound (f,Solver=>"SDPA");

##### DOCUMENTATION #####
#########################

Methods without documentation

--1) sosPoly--
--2) cleanSOS--
--3) toRing--
--4) sub(SOSPoly,Ring)--
--5) SOSPoly * SOSPoly--
--6) genericCombination--

Methods whose documentation needs improvement

7) sumSOS
8) roundPSDmatrix
9) choosemonp
10) lowerBound   TK: Calling it with parameters is not documented
11) lasserreHierarchy   TK: Options are not documented yet.

######### Comments and discussion ######
########################################

1) The randomness of the SDP solvers is a severe problem, for example
for the tests.  If a routine fails 1 out of 10 times, how should it be
    diego: ideally we should only export cases tha are reliable,
        at least with CSDP tested?

2) The function sosInIdeal is worthless if it can't even solve
    R = QQ[x,y,z];
    h = {x-y, x+z};
    (s,mult) = sosInIdeal (h,10, Solver=>"CSDP");
    diego: it seems to work with d=4, why did you choose d=10??

3) Maybe we should implement that each RingMap can be applied to an
   SOSpoly?

4) Should toRing really be in the interface of the package?  Maybe it
   would be better to have functions "makeCoefficientsRational" and
   "makeCoefficientsReal"?  The functions also have the problem that
   they assume that the user wants to change the coefficient field and
   the code is not taking care of the case that both coefficient
   fields are real or both rational.  If we include the function we
   should define its interface first.
   diego: my plan was to not export it. It's exported now for debugging purposes.

5) LDLdecomposition fails for {{1, -1, 1}, {-1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1}}

6) The following example only works with SDPA, but not M2 and not
   CSDP.  Can we do anything about it?
   needsPackage ("SOS" , Configuration => { "CSDPexec" => "CSDP/csdp", "SDPAexec"=>"./sdpa"})
   R = QQ[x,y]
   f = (x-y)^2 + x^2 + (y-4)^2;
   (bound, sol) = lowerBound(f, Solver=>"SDPA");
   -- the minimum is 16/3.
   result = (abs (16/3-bound) < 0.1)
